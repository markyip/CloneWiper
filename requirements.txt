# Core Dependencies
PySide6>=6.5.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
ImageHash>=4.3.0
send2trash>=1.8.0
rawpy>=0.19.0
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0       # For PDF/EPUB/MOBI/AZW3 thumbnails (required for EPUB/MOBI/AZW3, fallback for PDF)
mutagen>=1.47.0       # For music album art and metadata

# Optional Dependencies (Recommended for full feature support)
# Install these for additional features:
# opencv-python>=4.8.0  # For video thumbnails (standard version, no CUDA)
# opencv-contrib-python>=4.8.0  # For additional features including video thumbnails
# pypdfium2>=0.20.0     # For high-quality PDF rendering (preferred over PyMuPDF for PDF)

# GPU Acceleration for ORB (Optional, requires CUDA-enabled OpenCV)
# Note: Standard opencv-python does NOT include CUDA support
# 
# For GPU-accelerated ORB with CUDA 12.6, you have these options:
# 
# Option 1: Pre-built CUDA wheels (Recommended if available)
#   For CUDA 12.6, try:
#   pip install opencv-cu126  # If available for your Python version
#   Or check: https://github.com/cudawarped/opencv-python-cuda-wheels
# 
# Option 2: Build from source (Most reliable, but complex)
#   See GPU_ACCELERATION_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
#   Requires: CUDA Toolkit 12.6, cuDNN, CMake, Visual Studio
# 
# Option 3: Use standard opencv-python (CPU only, default)
#   pip install opencv-python>=4.8.0
#   This is the default and works well with CPU optimization
# 
# Compatibility:
# - OpenCV 4.11.0+ supports CUDA 12.6
# - Your system: CUDA 12.6, RTX 4070, Python 3.12.3
# - Current OpenCV: 4.11.0 (standard build, no CUDA)
# 
# After installing CUDA-enabled OpenCV, CloneWiper will auto-detect and enable GPU acceleration
